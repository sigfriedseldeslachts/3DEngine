# Custom 3D Engine

This is a custom 3D engine that I am developing for fun and learning purposes. The engine is written in C# and uses OpenGL (via Silk.NET) for rendering.

I wouldn't recommend using this engine for any serious projects as it's just a hobby project for myself.

Next semester I will be taking a course on computer graphics and so this motivated me to already start working on a 3D engine.
